## Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:
- `profiles`: User profile information
- `products`: Product details
- `categories`: Product categories
- `product_images`: Product image galleries
- `reviews`: Product reviews
- `orders`: Order information
- `order_items`: Items within orders

For detailed schema information, see [DATABASE_SCHEMA.md](docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md).

## Migration Management

This project uses Supabase migrations to manage the database schema. For information on how to work with migrations, see [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

If you're setting up a new environment, you can use the consolidated migration in `supabase/migrations/consolidated/baseline.sql`.
